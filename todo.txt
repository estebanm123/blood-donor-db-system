- add build to gitignore? to test locally

- Add Patients: do we really need to assign an ID to a patient every time time we add them
    or we can make the database automatically set the ID for the patient that has not been
    assigned yet (eg. we do not assign a transaction number to a request directly)?

- Request: patient ID, admin ID, Blood type, date, quantity
